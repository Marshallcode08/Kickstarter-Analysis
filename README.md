**Overview of the Project**

  The purpose of this project is to show our ability to utlize excel for gather data, clean the data, organize the data, and then display the data so other can interpret the data. Excel is a tool used throughout most companies and utlized for as an easy method to display information in school and work environments.
  
 **Challeneges**
 
    The biggest issue I encountered with this moduel is deliverable two. I macde so many silly mistake that made the chart look crazy and I could not figure it out. It took the tutors to help me figure out the issues, which was I created new sheets that made excel read the data wrong which messed up my chart. By using the kickstarter sheet I was able to input my code and it worked well with countifs function. I will show some examples of my messed up chart.

AS you can see the data is off, but once I was able to figure out how to fix the issues it was a breeze,but very tedious.

**Results**

  - Conclusion 1 is none of the plays were canceled.
  - Conclusion 2 plays with high goals and low pledges was a gurantee failure.
  - The conclusion that can be assumed from the outcome based on goals chart need to have high pledge amount in order for play to succeed.
  - The limitation that there is simply more factors that could contribute to a play failing that this dataset did not provide.
  - We could use a bar chart to compare the successful and failed data to gather comparative data to find similarities or differences that may have helped develope a better conclusion.
